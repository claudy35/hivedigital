        <h2 class="whyM">Why Invest in Website Maintenance?</h2>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Improved Security</h3>
        <p class="ww">Cybersecurity threats are rising in Nairobi and across Kenya, and SMEs are often the easiest targets. 
            With our website maintenance services in Nairobi, your business gets advanced protection against hackers, 
            malware, and data breaches. We install regular security patches, monitor suspicious activity, and keep your systems updated. 
            This ensures your customer data remains safe and your business reputation intact. A secure website not only prevents 
            financial loss but also builds trust with your Nairobi customers who expect safety when interacting online.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-server"></i> Higher Uptime</h3>
        <p class="ww">For SMEs in Nairobi, a website that goes down means lost customers, missed sales, 
            and wasted opportunities. That’s why we provide professional website monitoring and uptime support in Nairobi. 
            Our team ensures your site is always accessible, fixing issues before they escalate. High uptime means your 
            Nairobi customers can find you any time, day or night—turning your website into a reliable 24/7 business engine.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Better Performance</h3>
        <p class="ww">A fast, reliable, and user-friendly website is essential for business growth. Slow-loading pages frustrate visitors 
            and push them to competitors. With our website optimization and performance maintenance services in Nairobi,
             we make sure your site loads quickly, runs smoothly, and delivers a seamless customer experience. 
             By optimizing speed and fixing errors, we keep your Nairobi SME competitive online, 
             ensuring visitors stay longer and are more 
            likely to convert into paying customers.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Stronger SEO Rankings</h3>
        <p class="ww">If your business website doesn’t appear on Google when Nairobi customers search for your products or services, 
            you’re losing sales. Our SEO-driven website maintenance in Nairobi ensures your site stays search-engine friendly. 
            We optimize content, fix broken links, improve mobile responsiveness, and enhance technical SEO. 
            As a result, your SME gains higher rankings, increased visibility, and more organic traffic from Nairobi 
            and across Kenya—helping your business grow sustainably online.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Increased Trust</h3>
        <p class="ww">First impressions matter. A broken, outdated, or unsecured website can instantly push potential customers away. 
            With our website management services for SMEs in Nairobi, we ensure your website looks professional, functions properly, 
            and stays safe. Regular updates, fresh content, and proactive fixes keep visitors engaged and confident in your brand. 
            A well-maintained website builds trust, loyalty, 
            and repeat business—critical for Nairobi SMEs looking to expand their customer base.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Revenue Protection</h3>
        <p class="ww">Your website is more than just an online presence—it’s a revenue-generating asset. But downtime, 
            slow performance, or cyberattacks can directly cut into your profits. 
            That’s why we offer website maintenance solutions in Nairobi designed for SMEs. 
            By keeping your website operational, optimized, and secure, we safeguard your business income. 
            Protecting your digital storefront is protecting your revenue—and with us, 
            you’ll never have to worry about costly website failures again.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2 class="whyM">Common Risks of Neglecting Website Maintenance</h2>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> Cyberattacks</h3>
<p class="ww">For SMEs in Nairobi, neglecting website maintenance leaves your business open to hackers and malware. 
    Outdated systems and unpatched software are easy targets. 
    That’s why we provide proactive website security updates, firewall monitoring, and vulnerability fixes. 
    Our team ensures your site stays secure, keeping attackers out and protecting your brand reputation. 
    With us, your Nairobi SME is shielded against costly cyber threats.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Data Breaches</h3>
<p class="ww">Unmaintained websites put sensitive customer data at risk—emails, 
    phone numbers, even payment details. A single breach can lead to legal issues, fines, and loss of trust. 
    We safeguard your website with regular security scans, data protection protocols, 
    and compliance-friendly updates. With our maintenance support, your Nairobi SME stays trusted, compliant, 
    and secure—ensuring customer confidence remains intact.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Broken Functionality</h3>
<p class="ww">Nothing frustrates potential customers more than a website that fails to work properly—whether it’s broken links, 
    slow-loading pages, error messages, or malfunctioning forms. Each of these issues creates friction, leading to abandoned sessions, 
    missed sales, and lost opportunities. 
    Our dedicated maintenance team ensures your website remains fully functional through continuous monitoring, 
    timely bug fixes, and compatibility updates. We make sure Nairobi customers can browse, purchase, 
    and engage with your SME seamlessly, without costly interruptions.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Google Penalties</h3>
<p class="ww">If your website is not regularly updated, 
    Google can penalize it by lowering your search rankings and cutting off valuable organic traffic. 
    Outdated code, slow loading speeds, broken links, and unresolved SEO issues all reduce your visibility online. 
    Our professional maintenance services keep your site optimized, mobile-responsive, and fully search-engine friendly. 
    By improving technical SEO and performance, we ensure your Nairobi SME remains competitive, 
    ranks higher, and consistently attracts more customers.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-user-times"></i> Customer Churn</h3>
<p class="ww">A poorly maintained website inevitably drives customers away and harms your business reputation. 
    Broken pages, outdated designs, slow performance, 
    or visible “not secure” warnings immediately push visitors toward competitors who appear more reliable. 
    Our ongoing website maintenance service ensures your Nairobi SME always looks professional, loads quickly, 
    remains secure, and runs seamlessly. By providing consistent performance, we build long-term trust, strengthen customer loyalty, 
    reduce churn, and encourage repeat business growth.</p>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Loss of Competitive Edge</h3>
<p class="ww">In Nairobi’s fast-growing digital economy, customers compare businesses online before making decisions. 
    An outdated or poorly maintained website makes your SME look less credible than competitors. 
    Without regular upgrades, modern features, and fresh content, your brand risks being perceived as irrelevant. 
    We ensure your site evolves with market trends, keeping your Nairobi SME competitive 
    and appealing to today’s digital-first customers.</p>
